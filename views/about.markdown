## About

SimpleAuth does all the hard work of social account authentication on iOS. It has a small set of public APIs backed by a set of "providers" that communicate with various social services.

Installing SimpleAuth is easy. Just add the provider you want to your `Podfile`, like this: `pod 'SimpleAuth/Twitter'`

You can read more about the framework in the [readme](https://github.com/calebd/SimpleAuth/blob/master/Readme.markdown).
